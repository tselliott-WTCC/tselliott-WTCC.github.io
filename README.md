# About Me

## My Interests  
 I spend much of my free time watching movies at home. I have a movie collection of roughly one-thousand movies.  I also enjoy spending time with my kids playing video games or riding bikes. I have two dogs and a cat that are well-loved.

## Websites I Recommend
	*[IMDB](www.imdb.com)  
 The Internet Movie Database is the place to go when you need to look up a specific film, show, or cast member from nearly any time period. It can give relief to the agony of not being able to remember a show or an actor's name. **IMDB** is a great place to go for movie reviews as well.

	*![Reddit](www.reddit.com)  
 Reddit has gained much more relevance in mainstream media in   the last few years. I have used the site for many years. I find it to be  a great news aggregator	on many topics at once. Many website focus on a  specific subject, but Reddit is user-driven. The users post the content   for others to view. I am able to get my political, entertainment, and  scientific news all in one place. I ignore the social aspects of the  platform.
